 Why Maps Are Important
Quick access → You can get a value instantly by its key, no need to loop through everything.

Unique keys → Each key is stored only once.

Dynamic size → You can add/remove pairs without worrying about length.

Flexible → Keys can be string, int, etc., and values can be any type.
